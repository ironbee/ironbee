ChangeLog
Yeah, I know this isn't quite the right format.

TODO:

* more doco
* man pages

19-Mar-2010
	* Added "modp_dtoa2" same as dtoa2 but strips trailing zeros (Issue 9)
	* FIXED Issue 10 -- NaN not handled correctly in modp_dtoa(2).
	* ADDED more tests for NaN/Inf handling
	* FIXED some build issues under Ubuntu (64-bit) (sprintf annoyances in testing code)
        * REGENERATED that autoconf stuff.  Groan.  Hopefully it works for you.  If not
	  file a ticket, please!
        * VERSION 3.10 RELEASED

12-Feb-2010
	* FIXED Issue 7 - silent overflow error
        * FIXED Incorrect autoconf version
	* Issue 6 -- attempt to make VS2008 happy
	* VERSION 3.9 RELEASED


05-Jan-2008
	* Regenerated libtool/autoconf/autoheader/etc to fix
	  problem where ranlib was improperly being invoked on some systems
	* Added "std::" to some raw "string" in C++ methods
	* Added "#include <cstring>" to some headers for C++
	* Tested with latest snapshot of gcc/g++ with -Wall -Wextra
	* No logic changes
20-Nov-2007
	* modp_dtoa
	  Fixed round-to-even "rollovers" (e.g. 0.99, prec 1 -> 1.0)
	  Simplified "very small number" logic
	  Unit tests greatly improved.
	  thanks again to Johannes Otepka for finding bugs
	* VERSION 3.6 RELEASED
19-Nov-2007
	* modp_dtoa
	  Fixed round-to-even, and precision 0 rules to match printf
	  thanks to Johannes Otepka
	* VERSION 3.5 RELEASED

27-Jun-2007
	* VERSION 3.4 RELEASED

21-Jun-2007
	* Ugh.  Fix bug in url decode where core dump can occur if someone passes in %XX, where X
	  has high bit set (> 0x80).  Due to signed chars, this is interpreted as a negative, and
	  bad things happen.  Thanks to Andrei Khemmelis.
        * Improve more C++ methods, b64, b64w, b16 all have string, const string, const char* and
	  and (const char*, length) inputs now.
	* Added "make help" to give list of options

05-Jun-2007
	* VERSION 3.3 RELEASED

05-Jun-2007
	* Fix bug in modp_b16_gen that could core dump (doesn't not effect output, only occurs
	  during building).  Thanks to Constantine Verutin.

04-Jun-2007
	* toupper/lower now 2x faster than before!  Based on an alogirthm by Hsieh
	  http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/asmexample.html
	* C++ added more C++ methods for url_decode

24-May-2007
	* Version 3.2 released
	* Cleaned-up include guards, and 'extern c' stuff for C++.

23-May-2007
	* Add C++ "const" methods everywhere in case you don't want to 
	  modify the original input

15-May-2007
	* Removed CuTest since it's crap and leaks memory.

14-May-2007
	* added modp_ascii -- ascii transformations (upper/lower/etc) --
	  25x faster than ctype toupper,etc

13-May-2007
	* made b64_encode be about 30% faster on Intel based chip.
	  Minimal performance loss on AMD, G4
	  (now all platforms are faster than the apache encoder)
	* added modp_b2 -- ascii binary string encode/decode

22-Apr-2007
	* Release 3.1 
	* fixes some compliation problems on 64-bit platforms
	* add modp_numtoa, fast number to string conversions

06-Apr-2007
	* Release 3.0

03-Mar-2007:
	* initial import into google code

02-Sep-2006
	* New modp_64w which is the configurable base 64 alphabet.
	  The original modp_b64 will now be the standard base 64 alphabet
	  and is unchangable.  This way you can dump binary data into XML
	  use the standard, and make web urls (web-safe version)
	* Made modp_url_encode escape more characters.  This makes it
	  more standard.
	* Add modp_url_min_encode which does a more "minimal" encoding
	  RFC 3986 actually recommends encoding less characters (the
	  original was based for HTML form processing).
	* Improved documentation

28-Aug-2006
	* Added javascript encoding.  Convert c-string to a format suitable for
	  embedding into javascript (dynamically generated by the server for instance).
	* INTERFACE CHANGE use namespaces for C++ functions, and changed their names

16-May-2006: Release 2.0.0
	* New Prefix: everything is prefixed with modp_bXX, where XX is the
	   encoding type
	* Massive unit test coverage using CuTest library
	* New! bfasturl -- high performance url encode/decode!
	* New  bfast16 -- high performance hex encode/decode
	* New! C++ bindings using std::string

15-Mar-2006: Release v1.3
	* Version 1.2 b64fast_decode wrote a few extra bytes after the
	data as an optimization.  This have been changed so it write ONLY
	the extact number of byte encoded.  THis makes it more compatible
	with existing implementations and allows some tricks.  (decoding
	directly into a C-struct).

10-Mar-2006: Release v1.2
	* INTERFACE CHANGE -- b65fast_encode returns
	strlen of the result.  Not strlen+1 like apache.
	* Change b64 decode to only write the exact bytes (previously 
	  wrote a few extra 0s at the end for performance reasons)
	* Change b85 default alphabet to exclude ","  This allows use with
	V0/Netscape and V1 HTTP cookies.

20-Feb-2006:  Release v1.1
	* CRITICAL BUG FIX -- in some cases b64encode will produce bad output
	  this may only occur on some compilers
	* Added base85 functionality!
	* Cleaned up source code, added mode-lines, reindented
	* Renamed files to better reflect function

25-Dec-2005:  Initial Release v1.0.0
