<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>CLIPP (pronounced clip-pea) is a framework for generating, manipulating, and
consuming IronBee event streams.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Send a ModSecurity Audit Log, <code>february.log</code>, to a local IronBee configured
with `ironbee.conf``.</p>

<pre><code>clipp modsec:february.log ironbee:ironbee.conf
</code></pre>

<p><code>modsec</code> is a generator. It produces event streams. <code>ironbee</code> is a consumer.
It consumes the event streams, sending them to a local IronBee engine.</p>

<p>As previous, but also display the event stream to standard out:</p>

<pre><code>clipp modsec:february.log @view ironbee:ironbee.conf
</code></pre>

<p><code>@view</code> is a modifier. It takes event streams as inputs, displays them to
standard out, and passes them on to the next element in the stage.</p>

<p>Multiple generators are possible:</p>

<pre><code>clipp modsec:february.log modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf
</code></pre>

<p>The consumer must be unique though. Generators are processed in order, so all
events from <code>february.log</code> will be sent before events in <code>march.log</code>.</p>

<p>Modifiers can be attached to either generators or consumers. Below, the
<code>@view</code> modifier is attached only to the first generator and events from
<code>march.log</code> will not be displayed:</p>

<pre><code>clipp modsec:february.log @view modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf
</code></pre>

<p>To see all events we could attach an <code>@view</code> modifier to the <code>march.log</code>
generator or we could move the modifier to be attached to the consumer
instead:</p>

<pre><code>clipp modsec:february.log modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf @view
</code></pre>

<p>Spaces between components and modifiers are optional. Removing them, may make
which components they are attached to clearer.</p>

<pre><code>clipp modsec:february.log modsec:march.log ironbee:ironbee.conf@view
</code></pre>

<p>There are many generators, modifiers, and consumers. See below for specifics.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Configuration consists of chains. Each chain is a generator or a consumer
and zero or more modifiers. The last chain listed in the configuration is
interpreted as the consumer and all others as generators. There must be at
least two chains: a generator and a consumer.</p>

<p>Generators, consumers, and modifiers are all components. Components are
written as <code>name</code>:<code>argument</code> or, if <code>argument</code> is the empty string, just
<code>name</code>. Modifiers are distinguished by beginning with <code>@</code>. The component
they modify is referred to as the <em>base</em> component. Modifiers may be separated
from earlier components (base or previous modifier) by white space, but this
is optional.</p>

<p>Component names only consist of lower case letters and underscores. Arguments
may contain spaces but, if so, must be in double quotes. Note that these
quotes must make it to <code>clipp</code>, which usually means they are escaped on the
command line, e.g.,:</p>

<pre><code>clipp modsec:\&quot;my log.log\&quot; ironbee:ironbee.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Formally, the configuration grammar is, in pseudo-BNF:</p>

<pre><code>configuration := generators WS+ consumer
generators    := generator ( WS+ generator )*
generator     := chain
consumer      := chain
chain         := base modifiers
modifiers     := ( WS* modifier )*
modifier      := AT component
base          := component
component     := name [ COLON configuration ]
configuration := quoted | unquoted
quoted        := +(escaped | non_quote)
escaped       := BACKSLASH char
char          := /./
nonquote      := /[^&quot;]/
unquoted      := /[^\s]+/
name          := /[a-z_]+/
AT            := &quot;@&quot;
COLON         := &quot;:&quot;
WS            := &quot; &quot;
BACKSLASH     := &quot;\&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The grammar is likely to change in in the near future.</p>

<p>All arguments after the flags are joined with whitespace and treated as
configuration text. You may also ask <code>clipp</code> to load configuration from a
file via <code>-c</code> <em>path</em>. Configuration files may have comments by beginning a
line with <code>#</code>. All lines in the configuration file are otherwise joined with
whitespace. E.g.,</p>

<pre><code># input.log
modsec:input.log
# and then a single input at the end to 127.0.0.1:80
raw:a,b
   @set_local_ip:127.0.0.1
   @set_local_port:80
# all fed to ironbee with IDs displayed
ironbee:ironbee.conf
   @view:id
</code></pre>

<h2 id="input">Input</h2>

<p>An <em>Input</em> is the fundamental unit of data in <code>clipp</code>. Generators produce
them, modifiers modify them, and consumers consume them. An Input represents
a single connection with zero or more transactions. The Input format is
oriented around IronBee server plugin events and is designed to adapt to
future changes such as additional events.</p>

<p>An Input is an ID for human consumption and a Connection. The ID is optional,
and is mainly used by <code>@view</code> and <code>@view:id</code>, i.e., displayed to standard out
for human consumption.</p>

<p>A Connection is a list of pre-transaction Events, a list of Transactions, and
a list of post-transaction Events.</p>

<p>A Transaction is a list of Events.</p>

<p>An Event is an event identifier (which IronBee Event it corresponds to), a
pre-delay and a post-delay, both of which are floating point values measured
in seconds. Some consumers, e.g., <code>ironbee</code> will interpreted the pre- and
post- delay values by delaying for that many seconds before and after the
event is fired.</p>

<p>The following Events are currently defined:</p>

<p><strong>connection opened</strong> &#8212; Pre transaction only; contains local and remote IP
and ports.</p>

<p><strong>connection closed</strong> &#8212; Post transaction only; contains no data.</p>

<p>The remaining Events may only occur in a Transaction.</p>

<p><strong>connection data in</strong> &#8212; Contains data.</p>

<p><strong>connection data out</strong> &#8212; Contains data.</p>

<p><strong>request started</strong> &#8212; Contains some of raw data, method, uri, and protocol.</p>

<p><strong>request header</strong> &#8212; Contains zero or more headers, each of which is a name
and value.</p>

<p><strong>request header finished</strong> &#8212; Contains no data.</p>

<p><strong>request body</strong> &#8211; Contains data.</p>

<p><strong>request finished</strong> &#8212; Contains no data.</p>

<p><strong>response started</strong> &#8212; Contains some of raw data, status, message, and
protocol.</p>

<p><strong>response header</strong> &#8212; Contains zero or more headers, each of which is a name
and value.</p>

<p><strong>response header finished</strong> &#8212; Contains no data.</p>

<p><strong>response body</strong> &#8211; Contains data.</p>

<p><strong>response finished</strong> &#8212; Contains no data.</p>

<p>Typically, there are two classes of Inputs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Consists of a connection open event, then a sequence of transactions each
consisting of a connection data in and a connection data out event, and then a
connection closed event. These inputs are typical of generators that read
other formats including <code>modsec</code>, <code>apache</code>, <code>raw</code>, and <code>suricata</code>.
Unmodified, they are usually consumed by an IronBee that uses modhtp to
parse them.</p></li>
<li><p>Consists of a connection open event, then a sequence of transactions each
consisting of request started, request header, request body, request finished,
response started, response header, response body, response finished, and then
a connection closed event. These are meant to represent input to IronBee from
a source that already does basic parsing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other Inputs beyond the above two are certainly possible. E.g., connection
data in might occur several times in a row to test data that comes in batches.</p>

<h2 id="protobuffileformat">Protobuf File Format</h2>

<p>The CLIPP protobuf file format and it associated components: <code>pb</code> and
<code>writepb</code> are especially important. The protobuf format completely captures
the Input making it the most powerful and flexible format.</p>

<p>The Protobuf format is compact to begin with and uses gzip compression to
further reduce its size. If you have a lot of data that you are going to run
through <code>clipp</code> multiple times, consider converting it to protobuf format
first via <code>writepb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="generators">Generators</h2>

<p>All generators &#8211; except pcap &#8211; that take file system paths, support using
<code>-</code> to indicate stdin.</p>

<p>All generators except pb produce parsed events. Use @unparse if you want
data events instead.</p>

<p><strong>pb</strong>:<em>path</em></p>

<p>Generate Input from CLIPP Protobuf file.</p>

<p><strong>raw</strong>:<em>request</em>,<em>response</em></p>

<p>Generate events from a pair of raw files. Bogus IP and ports are used for the
connection opened event. You can override those with the <code>@set_</code><em>X</em>
modifiers.</p>

<p>This generator produces a single input with a single transaction.</p>

<p><strong>modsec</strong>:<em>path</em> &#8212; Generate events from ModSecurity audit log.</p>

<p>Serial ModSecurity audit logs &#8211; those that have multiple entries &#8211; are often
somewhat corrupted. CLIPP will emit a message, ignore, and continue
processing whenever it fails to parse an entry.</p>

<p>This generator produces an Input for each audit log entry. The Input consists
of a single transaction.</p>

<p><strong>apache</strong>:<em>path</em> &#8212; Generate events from an Apache log.</p>

<p>The log must be in NCSA format:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;%h %l %u %t \&quot;%r\&quot; %&gt;s %b \&quot;%{Referer}i\&quot; \&quot;%{User-agent}i\&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Only <code>Referer</code> and <code>User-Agent</code> headers are included. No bodies are included.</p>

<p>This generator produces an Input for each line of the log. The Input consists
of a single transaction with the fabricated request and response.</p>

<p><strong>suricata</strong>:<em>path</em> &#8212; Generate events from a Suricata log.</p>

<p>This generator behaves almost identically to <code>apache</code> but reads Suricata http
log format instead.</p>

<p><strong>htp</strong>:*path: &#8212; Generate events from a libHTP test file.</p>

<p>A libHTP test file is a sequence of request and response blocks. Request
blocks begin with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> on a line by itself and response blocks begin with
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> on a line by itself.</p>

<p>This generator produces a single Input from the file. The Input consists of
a transaction for every pair of request and response blocks. The connection
opened event has bogus information. Similar to <code>raw</code>, the connection
information can be specified with the <code>@set_</code><em>X</em> modifiers.</p>

<p>You may omit response blocks in which case they default to the empty string.
You may not omit request blocks.</p>

<p><strong>echo</strong>:<em>request</em>: &#8212; Generate a event with request line <em>request</em>.</p>

<p>This is mostly intended for debugging. There is no response body and the
request is a single line. Connection information is bogus.</p>

<p><strong>pcap</strong>:<em>path</em><br>
<strong>pcap</strong>:<em>path</em>:<em>filter</em></p>

<p>Generates inputs based on reassembled PCAP.</p>

<p>The PCAP is reassembled via libNIDS. It is somewhat fragile and may get
transaction boundaries wrong if there is a connection that has traffic flowing
simultaneously in both directions.</p>

<p>Note that only complete streams are generated as inputs. In particular, this
means that you will need both directions of traffic to get any inputs, e.g.,
use symmetric filters such as</p>

<pre><code>src 1.2.3.4 or dst 1.2.3.4
</code></pre>

<h2 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h2>

<p><strong>@view</strong></p>

<p>All Events are output to standard out in human readable format. Unprintable
characters are represented by <code>[</code><em>X</em><code>]</code> where <em>X</em> is the hex value.</p>

<p>If the string encoders (modp) library is available, URL decoded versions of
the raw request line and URI are also output.</p>

<p><strong>@view:id</strong></p>

<p>This modifier is identical to <code>@view</code> except only the IDs of each input are
displayed.</p>

<p><strong>@view:summary</strong></p>

<p>This modifier is identical to <code>@view</code> except a summary of each input is
displayed. The summary is the ID, connection information, and number of
transactions.</p>

<p><strong>@set_local_ip</strong>:<em>ip</em><br>
<strong>@set_local_port</strong>:<em>port</em><br>
<strong>@set_remote_ip</strong>:<em>ip</em><br>
<strong>@set_remote_port</strong>:<em>port</em><br></p>

<p>These modifiers change <em>every</em> connection opened event to use the given
parameters.</p>

<p><strong>@parse</strong></p>

<p>This modifier converts all connection data in events into request started,
request headers, request finished events and call connection data out events
into response started, response headers, and response finished events.</p>

<p>The parser used to do this is extremely simple. It, essentially, splits the
first line on spaces into three values (the request/response line values),
splits the next lines on : into two values (header key and value), and, when
it sees a blank line, treats the remainder of the data as the body.</p>

<p>At present, <code>@parse</code> does not support repeated connection data in or
connection data out events. Handling those properly (also repeat parsed
events) would require a smarter parser and handling those dumbly (join them
and process as a single block of text) was deemed more unexpected than
useful. So, if repeated events are present, an error will be displayed and
the input discarded.</p>

<p><strong>@unparse</strong></p>

<p>This modifier is the opposite of parse, converting the parsed events into
connection data in and connection data out events. It generates a single
connection data in (out) event for each set of request (response) events, even
if some of those events are repeated.</p>

<p><strong>@aggregate</strong><br>
<strong>@aggregate</strong>:<em>n</em><br>
<strong>@aggregate</strong>:<em>distribution</em>:<em>parameters</em></p>

<p>Aggregates multiple connections together. The first connection provides the
pre and post transactions events. Subsequent transactions have their
transactions appended to the first. When there are no more inputs or when
the number of transactions is at least <em>n</em>, the connection is passed on.
Note that the final connection may have less than <em>n</em> transactions, i.e.,
it will have the remainder.</p>

<p>If given a distribution and distribution parameters, the value of <em>n</em> will be
chosen at random for each output input. Supported distributions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>uniform:<em>min</em>,<em>max</em> &#8212; Uniform distribution from [<em>min</em>, <em>max</em>].</li>
<li>binomial:<em>t</em>,<em>p</em> &#8212; Binomial distribution of <em>t</em> trials with <em>p</em> chance of
 success.</li>
<li>geometric:<em>p</em> &#8212; Geometric distribution with <em>p</em> chance of success.</li>
<li>poisson:<em>mean</em> &#8212; Poisson distribution with mean <em>mean</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>@splitdata</strong>:<em>n</em><br>
<strong>@splitdata</strong>:<em>distribution</em>:<em>parameters</em></p>

<p>Splits data events up into multiple data events. The size in bytes is
dictated by <em>n</em> or by the given distribution. <code>@splitdata</code> supports the same
distributions as <code>@aggregate</code>.</p>

<p>The pre and post delays of the original event are maintained at the beginning
and end of the split up events. There is no delay between the split up
events.</p>

<p><strong>@splitheader</strong><br>
<strong>@splitheader</strong>:<em>n</em><br>
<strong>@splitheader</strong>:<em>distribution</em>:<em>parameters</em></p>

<p>Splits header events up into multiple header events. The size in header
lines is dictated by <em>n</em> or by the given distribution. <code>@splitheader</code>
supports the same distributions as <code>@aggregate</code>.</p>

<p>The pre and post delays of the original event are maintained at the beginning
and end of the split up events. There is no delay between the split up
events.</p>

<p><strong>@edit</strong>:<em>which</em></p>

<p>Edit part of each input in an editor. The environmental variable, <code>EDITOR</code>
determines which editor to use or <code>vi</code> if it is unset. The <em>which</em> parameter
can be any of:</p>

<ul>
<li>request &#8212; Request line.</li>
<li>request_header &#8212; Request header (all lines).</li>
<li>request_body &#8212; Request body.</li>
<li>response &#8212; Response line.</li>
<li>response_header &#8212; Response header (all lines).</li>
<li>response_body &#8212; Response body.</li>
<li>connection_in &#8212;- Connection data in.</li>
<li>connection_out &#8212;- Connection data out.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the editor exits non-zero then the original text is used.</p>

<p><strong>@limit</strong>:<em>n</em></p>

<p>Stop chain after <em>n</em> inputs. If there are additional later chains, <code>clipp</code>
will move onto the next one.</p>

<p><code>@limit</code> is written to play well with the other modifiers. However, it is
good practice (and behaves most intuitively) if you place it last in the
chain.</p>

<p><strong>@select</strong>:<em>which</em></p>

<p>Only allow certain inputs through. Inputs are indexed starting with 1.
<em>which</em> is a comma separated list of either single indices or ranges of
indices specified as <code>i-j</code>.</p>

<p><strong>@set</strong>:<em>key</em>:<em>value</em></p>

<p>Set headers with key <em>key</em> to value <em>value</em>. By default, changes both
request and response headers. If <em>key</em> is prefixed with &gt;, then only request
headers will be changed. If <em>key</em> is prefixed with &lt;, then only response
headers will be changed. If no header is present, no change is made (i.e.,
does not add headers). If a header appears multiple times, all instances are
changed.</p>

<p><strong>@add</strong>:<em>key</em>:<em>value</em></p>

<p>Add a header with key <em>key</em> and value <em>value</em> to the end of the headers list. See <code>@set</code> for <em>key</em> prefixes.</p>

<p><strong>@addmissing</strong>:<em>key</em>:<em>value</em></p>

<p>As <code>@add</code>, but only adds a header if no header with key <em>key</em> is present.</p>

<p><strong>@fillbody</strong></p>

<p>Adds any missing body events and replaces the contents of body events with an
appropriate number (based on Content-Length) or <code>@s</code>. This is useful for input
sources that lack bodies or for sanitizing sensitive bodies.</p>

<p>Any negative or unparsable value of Context-Length is treated as 0. Any value
over 1e6 bytes is treated as 1e6 bytes.</p>

<p><strong>@ironbee</strong>:<em>config</em>:<em>behavior</em></p>

<p>Run IronBee as a modifier. By default, this behaves as the consumer except
as a modifier, i.e., there can be later components.</p>

<p><em>behavior</em> is optional and can be <code>allow</code> or <code>block</code> with <code>allow</code> as the
default. If set to <code>block</code>, then inputs are blocked (prevented from
continuing) by default.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, IronBee rules can use the <code>clipp</code> action to control
clipp:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>clipp:allow</code> &#8211; Override behavior, allowing input to continue on.</li>
<li><code>clipp:block</code> &#8211; Override behavior, preventing input from continuing.</li>
<li><code>clipp:break</code> &#8211; Abort current chain, moving on to next chain.</li>
</ul>

<p>IronBee rules can also use the <code>clipp_announce</code> action to produce output:</p>

<pre><code>clipp_announce:&quot;Hello World&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>will cause clipp to output:</p>

<pre><code>CLIPP ANNOUNCE: Hello World
</code></pre>

<p>Note: <code>clipp_announce</code> supports var expansions.</p>

<p>Note: At present, there is no support for a multithreaded IronBee modifier.</p>

<p><strong>@time</strong></p>

<p>Outputs timing information to standard out. For each input, outputs id,
time in microseconds since start, and time in microseconds since previous input.</p>

<h2 id="consumers">Consumers</h2>

<p><strong>ironbee</strong>:<em>path</em></p>

<p>This consumer initializes an IronBee engine, loads <em>path</em> as configuration,
and feeds all events to it. The pre- and post- delay attributes of Events
are interpreted.</p>

<p>See <code>@ironbee</code> above.</p>

<p><strong>ironbee_threaded</strong>:<em>path</em>:<em>workers</em></p>

<p>This consumer behaves as <code>ironbee</code> except that it will spawn multiple worker
threads to notify IronBee of events. The <em>workers</em> argument specifies how
many worker threads to spawn.</p>

<p><strong>view</strong>
<strong>view:id</strong>
<strong>view:summary</strong></p>

<p>These consumer are identical to the modifiers of the same name except that they behave as a consumer, i.e., can appear as the final chain.</p>

<p><strong>writepb</strong>:<em>path</em></p>

<p>This consumer writes the Inputs to <em>path</em> in the CLIPP protobuf format. This
format perfectly captures the Inputs.</p>

<p><strong>writehtp</strong>:<em>path</em></p>

<p>This consumer writes all connection data in and out events to <em>path</em> in the
HTP test format. This consumer is really only useful when there is a
single input in unparsed format.</p>

<p><strong>writeraw</strong>:<em>path</em></p>

<p>This consumer writes all data out to raw files in a directory at <em>path</em>. Files are named after the input id, whether it is a request or response, and a serial number.</p>

<h2 id="extendingclipp">Extending CLIPP</h2>

<p>CLIPP is designed to be extendable via adding additional components:
generators, modifiers, and consumers. As a component writer, you will need to
be familiar with <code>input.hpp</code>.</p>

<p>All components are C++ functionals. You will need to write the functional
(probably as a class) and then modify <code>clipp.cpp</code> to add the functional to
the appropriate factory map (<code>clipp.cpp</code> has specific documentation for
doing this). If your functional can be instantiated with a single
<code>std::string</code> argument, then this addition is easy. Otherwise, you will also
need to write a factory functional which takes a single <code>std::string</code> argument
and returns the component functional.</p>

<p>All components use shared pointers to the Input class for their parameter.
This type is called an <code>input_p</code>. All components return a bool.</p>

<p>Generators take an <code>input_p&amp;</code> parameter. The parameter is guaranteed to be
non-singular, i.e., non-NULL. The generator can either reuse the Input
pointed to or reset the parameter to a new Input. The Generator should make
no assumptions about the value of the passed in Input. It can be reset, via</p>

<p>input = Input::Input();</p>

<p>A generator should return true if and only if it was able to generate an
Input. When it returns false, <code>clipp</code> will discard the Input and move on to
the next Generator.</p>

<p>Modifiers also take an <code>input_p&amp;</code> parameter. The parameter is guaranteed to
point to an incoming Input. The modifier can modify that Input or generate a
new Input based on it and change the parameter to point to the new one. The
modifier should return true if processing of this Input should continue and
false otherwise. Returning false is useful, e.g., for filters. If false is
returned, <code>clipp</code> will stop processing the Input and ask the Generator for the
next input.</p>

<p>When the generator returns false, a singular, i.e., NULL, input will be sent
through the modifier chain. This allows modifiers to detect end-of-input
conditions and produce additional input if appropriate, e.g., for
aggregation or reordering. Modifiers that are not concerned with end-of-input
conditions should immediately return true when passed a singular input. The
chain will be complete when the generator returns false and a singular input
reaches the consumer.</p>

<p>Consumer take a <code>const input_p&amp;</code> parameter. They are, however, allowed to
modify the pointed to Input if that helps them. The Input will be not be
read after the Consumer runs. Consumers should return true if they were able
to process the input and false otherwise. If a consumer returns false,
<code>clipp</code> will emit an error message and exit.</p>

<p>All components should indicate error conditions by throwing standard
exceptions. Errors during construction will cause <code>clipp</code> to exit. Errors
during Input processing will cause <code>clipp</code> to emit an error and move on to the
next input. Thus, e.g., if a Consumer suffers a fatal error it should both
throw an exception and arrange to return false in the future.</p>

<p>The Input classes provide a variety of routines to ease component writing.
For Generators, there are methods to easily add new Transactions and Events.
For Modifiers, there is a <code>ModifierDelegate</code> class and <code>dispatch</code> methods to
visit every Event in a non-const fashion. For Consumers, there is a
<code>Delegate</code> class and <code>dispatch</code> methods to visit every Event in a
const-fashion, with, if desired, delays.</p>

<p>As functionals, components must be easily copied. A standard technique to
handle this (and to encapsulate implementation) is to have the functional
classes hold only a shared pointer to a declared but not defined internal
state class.</p>

<p>For simple examples see:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>raw_generator.[ch]pp</code></li>
<li><code>view.[ch]pp</code></li>
<li><code>connection_modifiers.[ch]pp</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="appendix1:protobuftofromjsonrubyhash">Appendix 1: Protobuf to/from JSON/Ruby Hash</h2>

<p>CLIPP comes with two scripts to convert between protobuf and a JSON based
format. These are <code>pb_to_json.rb</code> and <code>json_to_pb.rb</code>. Both act as filters,
taking input on stdin and writing output to stdout.</p>

<p>These scripts are simple, fragile, and load all input into memory. The
resulting JSON is a direct conversion of the protobuf and not as friendly to
user editing as might be desired: for example, event types are identified by
number. As such, the scripts are primarily intended to be used for tweaking
inputs produced by other means.</p>

<p>The <code>json_to_pb.rb</code> script actually converts the JSON to a Ruby Hash and the
Ruby Hash to protobuf. The hash to protobuf conversion is available to Ruby
scripts in <code>hash_to_pb.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="appendix2:clippbasedunittests">Appendix 2: CLIPP Based Unit Tests</h2>

<p>CLIPP comes with a unit test suite and support for writing unit tests that
use clipp. This testing infrastructure is an extension to Ruby <code>Test::Unit</code>.
If you are unfamiliar with <code>Test::Unit</code>, read up on that before continuing.</p>

<p>CLIPP Testing Support comes with three types of extensions. They can be
accessed by including the <code>CLIPPTest</code> mixin.</p>

<p>The main additions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A command <code>clipp</code> which invokes CLIPP and stores the output.</li>
<li>A set of assertions about the most recent <code>clipp</code> invocation.</li>
<li>A set of helper routines for generating CLIPP inputs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The <code>clipp</code> command</strong></p>

<p>The <code>clipp</code> command takes a configuration hash. The current best practice is
to pass in any configuration as command line options and define inputs via
ClippScript (see <code>clippscript.md</code>).</p>

<p>All options are provided to the ERB template for generating the IronBee
configuration file.</p>

<p>Currently meaningful options modifying how CLIPP is invoked are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>:input</code> &#8212; A CLIPP chain to use as input, e.g., <code>htp:my.t</code>.</li>
<li><code>:input_hashes</code> &#8212; An array of specially formatted hash representing
 CLIPP Inputs. You will usually construct the hashes with helper functions
 rather than directly. The hash is the same as described in Appendix 1.</li>
<li><code>:template</code> &#8211; A path to an ERB template to use for the IronBee
 configuration file. The result (as a path) can be referenced in
 <code>:consumer</code> via <code>IRONBEE_CONFIG</code>. This defaults to <code>ironbee.config.erb</code>
 in the tests directory.</li>
<li><code>:consumer</code> &#8211; A CLIPP consumer chain. If omitted, <code>ironbee:IRONBEE_CONFIG</code>
 is used. <code>IRONBEE_CONFIG</code> is replaced with a path to the evaluation of the
 ERB file specified via <code>:template</code>.</li>
<li><code>:id</code> &#8211; An identifier used to generate files. If omitted, a random number if used.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of <code>:input</code>, <code>:input_hashes</code>, or a ClippScript block is required. is
required. If <code>:input_hashes</code> or ClippScript is provided, protobuf will be
provided to stdin and <code>:input</code> will default to <code>pb:-</code>.
If you override <code>:input</code>, e.g., to add modifiers, be sure to begin
with <code>pb:-</code> as the generator.</p>

<p>The following options are used by the default IronBee configuration template:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>:config</code> &#8212; Text inserted before the default site section.</li>
<li><code>:default_site_config</code> &#8212; Text inserted in the default site section.</li>
<li><code>:config_trailer</code> &#8212; Text inserted after the default site section.</li>
<li><code>:log_level</code> &#8212; The log level to run at. Defaults to <code>notice</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assertions</strong></p>

<p>The following assertions are supported.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>assert_log_match</code> <em>regex</em> &#8212; Asserts that <em>regex</em> appears in the output
 of the most recent CLIPP invocation.</li>
<li><code>assert_log_no_match</code> <em>regex</em> &#8212; Asserts that <em>regex</em> does <strong>not</strong> appears
 in the output of the most recent CLIPP invocation.</li>
<li><code>assert_log_every_input_match</code> <em>regex</em> &#8212; Asserts that <em>regex</em> matches every input. This requires the inputs to pass through <code>@view:summary</code>. If you override the default consumer, you will need to explicitly specify the modifier.</li>
<li><code>assert_log_every_input_no_match</code> <em>regex</em> &#8212; As above, but asserts that <em>regex</em> is not matched.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Input Generation</strong></p>

<p>Instead of using the routines below, consider using ClippScript (<code>clippscript.md</code>).</p>

<p>Helper routines are provided to generate inputs. Ultimately, these produce
hashes to be passed to CLIPP via the <code>:input_hash</code> option.</p>

<p>Routines that generate hashes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>simple_hash(</code><em>request</em>, <em>response</em><code>)</code> &#8212; Behaves identically to the raw
 generator, i.e., produces a single connection with a single transaction
 with connection data in and connection data out events.</li>
</ul>

<p>Routines that return text to be used in the hash generating routines.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>erb(</code><em>erb_text</em>, <em>context</em><code>)</code> &#8212; Evaluates <em>erb_text</em> as ERB. In the ERB,
 <em>context</em> is available via the local variable <code>c</code>. The <em>context</em> parameter
 defaults to the empty hash.</li>
<li><code>erb_file(</code><em>erb_path</em>, <em>context</em><code>)</code> &#8212; As above, but the ERB text is loaded
 from the file at <em>erb_path</em>.</li>
</ul>
